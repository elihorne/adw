                <P><b>List are more fun then awkward third person bios, so here are some interesting facts:</b></P>
                
                <p>

<p>- I'm a NYC based Director / DP with an emphasize on creative nonfiction, with an overlap into commercial and narrative. </p>

<p>- I love anything and everything with two wheels, especially vintage motorcycles.  It keeps me a kid at heart.  </p>

<p>- By this point I have shot in over 10 countries, the highlights being Bolivia, Colombia and China.  I have travel to upwards of 20. </p>

<p>- I define my approach to lighting as naturalistic and minimalistic. My style is further defined by framing and movement, with a strong connection to still photography.  </p>

<p>- I covered the 2008 election for a doc series for the IFC.  I got to hang out on Obama's plane and drive in a motorcade.  Pretty awesome.  </p>

<p>- I have worked with crews as small as just a producer and as big as having 10+ clients watching in video village. Not to mention art department, G&E and the rest. </p>

<p>- I have been bitten by fire ants while shooting on a coco farm in the Amazon basin, and have the scars to prove it.  </p>

<p>- Some of my agency work includes: JWT, Draft FCB, AB&C, Pipeline NY </p>

<p>- A few networks I have shot for include: PBS, Showtime, IFC, TLC, MTV, </p>

<p>- Some clients and brands I have shot for include: ETSY, Macy's, Budweiser, Smirnoff, Puma, Tate Modern, PETA </p>

<p>- Did you know a 2000 watt generator will not power a 800watt HMI at 14,000 feet above sea level?  Ask me about it, its an interesting story. </p>

<p>- I wasn't on a plane until I was 21.  Since I have racked up a ridiculous amount of miles, recognize staff at JFK, have elite status with Delta and want to move to Amsterdam partly because I love Schiphol Airport!  </p>

<p>- Need a great gaffer in Dallas? Got that.  Need an awesome sound man in DC? Got that too. By this point I have worked in a majority of the country.  </p>

<p>- I have shot on the RED, Sony F3, Canon C300, HDSLRS, Varicam and most other cameras.</p>
