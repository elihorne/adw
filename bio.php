                <P><b>List are more fun then awkward third person bios, so here are some interesting facts:</b></P>
                
<p>

<p>- I'm a NYC based Director / DP with an emphasis on creative nonfiction, with an overlap into commercial and narrative </p>

<p>- I love anything and everything with two wheels, especially vintage motorcycles.  It keeps me a kid at heart.  </p>

<p>- My work has taken me to such distinct locales as Bolivia, Colombia and China.  To date I have travelled to upwards of 20 countries. </p>

<p>- My approach to lighting can best be defined as naturalistic and minimalistic. My style is further defined by its framing, movement, and strong connection to still photography.  </p>

<p>- I covered the 2008 election for a documentary series ("2008 Uncut") for the IFC.  I hung out on the plane Obama used during his campaign  and was also at one point in his motorcade.  Pretty awesome.  </p>

<p>- I have worked with crews of all shapes and sizes: from just a producer to 10+ clients watching in video village -- not to mention the art department, G&E and all the rest. </p>

<p>- I have been bitten by fire ants while shooting on a coco farm in the Amazon basin, and have the scars to prove it.  </p>

<p>- Some of my agency work includes: JWT, Draft FCB, AB&C, Pipeline NY </p>

<p>- A few networks I have shot for include: PBS, Showtime, IFC, TLC, MTV, </p>

<p>- Some clients and brands I have shot for include: ETSY, Macy's, Budweiser, Smirnoff, Puma, Tate Modern, PETA </p>

<p>- Did you know a 2000 watt generator will not power a 800watt HMI at 14,000 feet above sea level?  Ask me about it, its an interesting story. </p>

<p>- I didn't fly on a plane until I was 21.  Since then I have racked up a ridiculous amount of miles; recognize staff at JFK; have elite status with Delta and want to move to Amsterdam partly because I love Schiphol Airport!  </p>

<p>- Need a great gaffer in Dallas? Got that.  Need an awesome sound man in DC? Got that, too. By this point I have worked in most major US metropolitan areas.  </p>

<p>- I have shot on the RED, Sony F3, Canon C300, HDSLRS, Varicam and most other cameras.</p>
