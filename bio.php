                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>List are more fun then awkward third person bios, so here are some interesting facts:<p>
<p>
- I'm a NYC based Director / DP with an emphasize on creative nonfiction, with an overlap into commercial and narrative. <br>

- I love anything and everything with two wheels, especially vintage motorcycles.  It keeps me a kid at heart. <br>

- By this point I have shot in over 10 countries, the highlights being Bolivia, Colombia and China.  I have travel to upwards of 20. <br>

- I define my approach to lighting as naturalistic and minimalistic. My style is further defined by framing and movement, with a strong connection to still photography. <br>

- I covered the 2008 election for a doc series for the IFC.  I got to hang out on Obama's plane and drive in a motorcade.  Pretty awesome. <br>

- I have worked with crews as small as just a producer and as big as having 10+ clients watching in video village. Not to mention art department, G&E and the rest.<br>

- I have been bitten by fire ants while shooting on a coco farm in the Amazon basin, and have the scars to prove it. <br>

- Some of my agency work includes: JWT, Draft FCB, AB&C, Pipeline NY<br>

- A few networks I have shot for include: PBS, Showtime, IFC, TLC, MTV,<br>

- Some clients and brands I have shot for include: ETSY, Macy's, Budweiser, Smirnoff, Puma, Tate Modern, PETA<br>

- Did you know a 2000 watt generator will not power a 800watt HMI at 14,000 feet above sea level?  Ask me about it, its an interesting story. <br>

- I wasn't on a plane until I was 21.  Since I have racked up a ridiculous amount of miles, recognize staff at JFK, have elite status with Delta and want to move to Amsterdam partly because I love Schiphol Airport! <br>

- Need a great gaffer in Dallas? Got that.  Need an awesome sound man in DC? Got that too. By this point I have worked in a majority of the country. <br>

- I have shot on the RED, Sony F3, Canon C300, HDSLRS, Varicam and most other cameras… <br>
